# Iris Detection Algorithm for Assessing Consciousness 

## Overview 

This project features an iris detection algorithm designed to assess consciousness by calculating the ratio between the iris and pupil. The innovative approach is recognized by medical professionals for its significant impact on patient outcomes, aiding doctors in monitoring and assessing patient alertness and response time. 

## Key Features 

* Machine Learning-Based Calculation: Utilizes advanced image processing to accurately identify the iris and pupil in an eye image. 

* Consciousness Assessment: Determines consciousness levels by calculating the iris-to-pupil ratio, with a threshold ratio (e.g., around 1.4) indicating a conscious state. 

* Medical Recognition: The feature has been acknowledged by doctors for its practical application in patient assessments. 

## How It Works 

* The algorithm processes an input image or a real-time capture from a camera. 

* It identifies the eye's key structures and measures the iris and pupil diameters. 

* The calculated iris-to-pupil ratio is displayed on the upper part of the screen, showing if the person is likely conscious or unconscious. 

* The user can end the session by pressing the 'q' key.
